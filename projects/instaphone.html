        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          InstaPhone Accessories is a company I founded to sell phone cases and accessories that stand out.
          I wanted the brand to feel like a blend of style and nostalgia, with products that people actually want to show off,
          not just basic protection.
        </p>

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Founded the brand and shaped the product direction and aesthetic</li>
          <li>Developed and executed digital marketing strategies to drive traffic and sales</li>
          <li>Designed website banners and product graphics to keep the store visually consistent</li>
          <li>Tested creative ideas and product positioning based on what people engaged with</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How I approached it</h3>
        <p>
          I treated this like a real product and marketing sandbox. I focused on two things.
          First, making the brand feel recognizable and consistent. Second, making each product feel like it has a story,
          so it is easier to market and easier for customers to connect with.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Built a brand identity and product direction from the ground up</li>
          <li>Strengthened hands-on skills in digital marketing, creative execution, and e-commerce workflow</li>
          <li>Learned how to turn product ideas into visuals and messaging that feel clickable and shareable</li>
        </ul>
