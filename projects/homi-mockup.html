        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Homi is a prototype style dashboard for college roommates. The idea is simple. Most roommate conflict comes from unclear expectations and small things that pile up.
          Homi turns those everyday friction points into lightweight systems, so the house runs smoother and people feel heard.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Helped shape the concept into a clear set of features that solve real roommate problems</li>
          <li>Designed a structured dashboard experience that feels easy to scan and easy to use</li>
          <li>Built and presented the mockup as part of a team deliverable</li>
          <li>Helped create a story that made the product feel real, not just theoretical</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What the demo includes</h3>
        <p>
          The demo is organized like a real product, with modules that support shared living workflows.
          You can explore features like a roommate contract editor, chores, bills, a monthly calendar, quick polls, and a simple rewards view. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Smart contract editor for house expectations and policies</li>
          <li>Chore board and rotation tracking</li>
          <li>House bills tracking and a split calculator</li>

          <li>Quick polls and a lightweight house chat</li>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
          This project helped my group land first place in our presentations because it felt practical and complete.
          It was not just a concept. It looked and behaved like something you could actually use, which made the value easy to understand.
