      <p class="proj-sub">
        I’m a junior student athlete at Washington University in St. Louis studying Marketing and Organization and Strategic Management, with a minor in Human Computer Interaction.
        I care about building experiences that are inclusive, clear, and genuinely useful.

          <h3>My why</h3>
          <p>
            My interest in product and marketing comes from one core belief.
            The choices we make in design and storytelling shape who feels included and who gets left out.
          </p>
          <p>
          I want a career where I can combine strategy, creativity, and structured thinking to build work that actually opens doors for more people. I care deeply about access and representation, not as a buzzword, but because inclusive thinking leads to stronger ideas, better decisions, and more meaningful impact.
